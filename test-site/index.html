		<h2>Best game in the market</h2>
		<img src= "images/r6.jpg" alt="uh oh spagettio, the image didnt show">
		<p> This is the game I play in my Down Time. Its called Rainbow 6 Seige and in my own opinion,
		 its the best game on the market right now.</p>
		 
<p> R6 (rainbow 6 for short) is a game similar to chess, to explain it simply.
in the game there are many different aspects that I like</p>


	<ul>

	
	
		<li> there are different "operators", or characters that you can choose from.
		my go to on defense is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mute+rainbow+6+&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiFysig6o_rAhVDs6wKHZErDBYQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=mute+rainbow+6+&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECAAQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHjoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoHCAAQsQMQQzoFCAAQsQM6AggAUMOUAli3uQJg6sECaABwAHgAgAFOiAHVB5IBAjE1mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=MtEwX4XpA8PmsgWR17CwAQ&bih=574&biw=635&tbs=sur%3Afc&hl=en#imgrc=eiOptkH_zF5fNM">Mute</a> who is in the pic above, or if i didn't go back and fix that the click on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mute+rainbow+6+&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiFysig6o_rAhVDs6wKHZErDBYQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=mute+rainbow+6+&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECAAQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHjoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoHCAAQsQMQQzoFCAAQsQM6AggAUMOUAli3uQJg6sECaABwAHgAgAFOiAHVB5IBAjE1mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=MtEwX4XpA8PmsgWR17CwAQ&bih=574&biw=635&tbs=sur%3Afc&hl=en#imgrc=eiOptkH_zF5fNM">Mute</a> and there will be a link to his image.</li>
		<li> the maps on this game are awesome, if you ask any R6 player they will tell you how important map knowledge is. </li>
		<li> and the best part of the game would have to be, finding and keeping a good crew, because its 5 on offense and 5 on defense, and if your 4 other guys
		are not very good, then its hard to win.</li>
